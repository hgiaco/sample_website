  
## About Us

This is a sample website created through the process of my technical development as guided by the exeptional "Learn Enough™" series of tutorials. The creation of this website, specifically, is guided by the ["Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous"][Learn Enough] tutorial, the first in the Learn Enough™ program's "Web Basics" series (the second series in its program).  

At the time of writing this About page, I am unaware of what will be the contents of the site. I *will*, however, practice my nacent Markdown skills by **seemingly-arbitrarilly** deploying Markdown syntax. In addition to that exercise, I will also provide a link to the website's homepage: [hgiaco's homepage][home].  

With that said, I will leave you with a quote \(using "lazy" Markdown syntax\)...

> "Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the \> \[angle bracket\] before the first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph..."
